HassMic will be the recommended microphone AND mediaplayer for View Assist as soon as it is out of beta which also won't be very long.  Some of us have been using it for many weeks now as the replacement for the microphone apps we have listed on the wiki and it is MUCH more robust, responsive and easy to use.
